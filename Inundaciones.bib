  abstract = {This article presents a methodology for generating flood risk maps that articulates hazard and vulnerability maps. The methodology can be adapted to different urban areas, and the maps obtained allow to estimate structural and household damage cost. Different criteria, used in several countries, to establish danger of flood based on calculating water depth and flow velocity in streets, streams and rivers are first reviewed. Two factors that are deemed important, namely resistance to overturning and sliding are integrated into the hazard maps. A methodology based on information generated by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and contained in its basic geostatistical areas (AGEBs) was developed to calculate vulnerability maps of buildings in an entire urban area. The case study was the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas where flood risk maps, housing vulnerability and hazard maps of the entire city were calculated. Structural and housing household damage costs were estimated, evacuation routes were identified and previously proposed shelter locations were revised.},

The volume addresses impacts that have already occurred and risks of future impacts, especially the way those risks change with the amount of climate change that occurs and with investments in adaptation to climate changes that cannot be avoided. For both past and future impacts, a core focus of the assessment is characterizing knowledge about vulnerability, the characteristics and interactions that make some events devastating, while others pass with little notice.},
